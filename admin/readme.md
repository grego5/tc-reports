A web app I developed back in 2013 for creating attack reports on wars we had in the game @ torn.com.  
Using curl library it would fetch data from the site, with authorization.  
The processed data then used to generate a report saved as xml file.  
Then the xml report can viewed through the app, after it has been processed with xslt template to create styled html page.
